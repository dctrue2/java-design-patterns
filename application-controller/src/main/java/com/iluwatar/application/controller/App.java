 * Application-Controller is a pattern that is commonly used when implementing user interfaces.
 * It centralizes action and view management in an application controller class.
 *
 * <p>In this example we have an application controller ({@link ApplicationController}) that
 * coordinates user input and the display of different pages. {@link SiteMapper} maintains a map 
 * that links characters to the {@link Target} objects: {@link Home}, {@link About} and 
 * {@link Contact}. The ApplicationController's method, "handler", retrieves references to the 
 * target objects from the map and invokes the targets' "invoke" methods.
